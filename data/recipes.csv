2,195,my favorite savory chicken salad,"this is for people who cringe at the thought of fruit in their chicken salad!  there are no raisins... no grapes... no pineapple bits... nothing sweet in this recipe!!  i grew up on the salty flavors of the chicken salad from the new york deli in boulder, co.  it was delicious!  they closed many years ago - and that drove me to make my own version.  here it is!  serve on a toasted bagel (my favorite) or stuff in a pita, or in a croissant - fancy!  always delicious!","cut of your cooked chicken into small , bite size pieces
mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl , combine well
that's it !
watch your mayonnaise as you go -- we like ours on the dry side -- if you love mayo - you can always add more -- but it's really hard to take out if you add too much
be careful people ! i recommend hellmans brand mayo -- good flavor
you could add some slivered almonds - if you like that kind of thing
also - you can use any kind of cooked chicken: baked , boiled , sauteed , crock pot -- a roasted chicken from the grocery store ! it all works and tastes great !
take a little nibble of your mixture and see how it tastes
adjust seasonings to taste
my mom always said that if your recipe doesn't taste quite right -- add a little more salt
that was her secret -- and she was right !
slather your chicken salad on your favorite bread of choice and enjoy !
yum yum !",2013-05-16

13,69,french onion soup  the cook s illustrated way,"i used to caramelize the onions on the stove top, but now i use this fantastic method. finally, a way to make genuine french onion soup without all of the stirring. while it still takes quite some time, the onions are roasted in the oven. 
sweet onions, such as vidalia or walla walla, will make this recipe overly sweet, so use yellow or red, or a combo of both.
use broiler-safe crocks and keep the rim of the bowls 4 to 5 inches from the broiler to obtain a proper melting of the cheeses. 
cooks illustrated chefs prefer using swanson certified organic free range chicken broth and pacific beef broth, tho others will do fine as well. there is actually more flavor and depth in chicken broth than in beef and that is why they combine it with the beef broth. 
much of the cooking time is passive...and the aroma makes the kitchen smell divine!
for the best flavor, make the soup a day or 2 in advance, it also freezes well in 2 gallon freezer bags. 
prep time includes the soup and the croutons. cooking time is approximate, please use your judgment.
i make this every christmas eve along with appetizers and those that missed christmas eve insist on having a bowl on christmas morning! lol it truly is the best french onion soup i have ever tasted. for those special occasions, try this one. hope you enjoy!","for the soup:

109,86,new york bakery style chinese cookies,"this is my favorite cookie recipe, and they really are very similar to what they call chinese cookies in the new york bakeries.  people really like them.  they have a great flavor and an interesting texture.  they are crisp and a bit crumbly once bitten into without being hard, and a great cookies for mailling.

they are also versatile.  the recipe is for vanilla cookies, but there are other decorating and add-ins that are listed in the recipe that make them even better.  my favorite is to make them into marble cookies, as explained in the recipe.  

you can substitute all-purpose flour for the cake flour with very similar results, which i do quite often.  instead of 3 1/2 cups, use 3 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch, sifted before using.

also note that if using an egg wash to adhere decorations to the dough log, you can use just a yolk or white you have saved from another use instead.

the time is estimated based on the marlbe cookie variation.  it will take less if you're making them plain.  it does not include chilling time.","in a medium bowl , cream together the sugar and shortening
stir in the egg and vanilla , then beat until light and fluffy
combine the cake flour , baking soda and salt
stir into the creamed mixture until well-blended
the dough will be stiff , so you may need to use your hands to mix depending on the strength of your mixer
roll dough into a log about 15 inches long
if you find the dough falling apart too much , knead one teaspoon of milk at a time into the dough until it will hold up to shaping
if desired , you can coat the log with ground nuts or colored or chocolate sprinkles before chilling and slicing
beat the egg , egg white or yolk with a tablespoon of water , brush over the log , then roll the log in your choice of coating , pressing them in a bit
red and green sprinkles mixed together and used to edge the vanilla cookies is really nice around the holidays
instructions for marble cookies are given below
wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap or wax paper and refrigerate for about 1 / 2 hour
if you chill them longer , let the log sit out for a bit before slicing or the dough will be too hard and may crumble
to bake , preheat oven to 350 degrees
grease cookie sheets
unwrap dough and using a very thin , sharp knife , cut into 1 / 2 inch slices
this dough is a bit difficult to work with , and may tend to crumble
if it does , let it warm up a bit more before slicing
place cookies 1 1 / 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets
if you prefer , gently adjust the edges of the cookies to make them as close to a circle as possible
lightly press a chocolate star , walnut half , or any other similar addition in the center of each cookie
bake for 10 to 15 minutes , or until just barely browned around the edges and the middle has set
if making the smaller cookies , bake for 9-12 minutes
allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack
one possible variation is melting some chocolae chips with a small bit of vegetable shortening and then piping a star onto the center of each baked and cooled cookie , then putting them in the refrigerator until the chocolate is set
to make marble cookies::
divide the finished dough in half , and add 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 1-2 tablespoons of milk to one of the halves and blend well
roll both flavors out to separate logs , then put one on top of the other and press lightly together
twist in a few places and and fold the dough over on itself once or twice to marble the dough , but not too much because you want a nice distinct marble with a bit of thin , delicate swirls here and there and look really nice once they're baked
then roll into one or two logs , chill , slice and bake as directed above
for christmas , try separating the dough into 3 or 4 parts , coloring one red , one green , and one chocolate , leaving a 4th section plain , and then marbleing
for halloween , use orange coloring instead of plain marbled with chocolate dough
these look great with a chocolate star placed or piped onto the center of the cookie
these cookies are nice and crisp without being hard , and will keep well kept in a covered plastic container or plastic bag",2008-11-10

this recipe is an original ""lunatic fudge"" variation of mamie eisenhower fudge. it's simple to make, sets up very nicely without refrigeration, and has an excellent taste and texture. don't be surprised if your friends tell you this is the best fudge they've ever had in their life. honest. all i ask is that you don't modify this recipe, change it's name, or remove my copyright. 

original recipe. (c) 1997 t. skaarup. may be copied without modification. all rights reserved.

by the way, cooking time is not ""passive"" work time because you have to stir the mixture the entire time it is cooking!","line a 13"" x 9"" pan with aluminum foil , butter the insides , and set aside
place chips , vanilla & butter flavor , about half the marshmallow creme , chilled butter , and nuts into a large saucepan or pyrex glass dish and set aside
use medium heat to bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or single stem hand mixer
add marshmallow creme - fold in - the boil will stop
bring back to a rolling boil and continue to boil for 8 full minutes by the clock
use the lowest flame possible to keep the rolling boil
the mixture will expand and start to turn brown during the boil
if you get brown flakes in the mixture then turn down the heat a little and continue stirring
remove from heat and pour hot mixture over chips , vanilla , butter , butter flavor , and nuts without scraping the sides of the hot saucepan
mix thoroughly and pour into prepared pan
cool 2-3 hours at room temperature
remove from pan , remove foil , cut into squares
store in an airtight container with wax paper dividers for up to 2 weeks
makes about 4 pounds of fudge
the stuff grows: after adding the marshmallow crme and butter to the hot milk / sugar solution , the volume will expand to almost twice the original volume
so use a sufficiently large sauce pan
as the boil continues , the volume will begin to contract
stirring is important to help distribute the heat throughout the mixture and prevent scorching
remember , this recipe calls for two [2] sauce pans -- one to boil and one to mix
you can substitute: if you don't have access to milk chocolate chips then you may use 24 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips - though it has a stronger chocolate taste
two large hershey bars will more than substitute for the milk chocolate chips
you can also use 24 ounces of white chips for an excellent vanilla fudge
don't be shy about substituting mini-marshmallows for the marshmallow crme
make half a batch: you may cut the recipe in half but the boil time must be reduced to [5] full minutes by the clock
i would also recommend a 9"" x 9"" pan
you can also substitute 5 ounces of evaporated milk for 6 ounce
persevere: this is a much more liquid mix than other fudge recipes and you might get discouraged midway
keep going
i've nearly given up several times only to have it set extremely well once cast
nervous nelly: if you're afraid this won't set or if you just want a more firm fudge then bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil for a full minute before adding the marshmallow
during the second boil go for 9 or 10 minutes
this will set very quickly and be a much firmer fudge
don't panic: if you use a candy thermometer the temperature will not reach the normal 232-236f found in other fudge recipes
it will attain something around 220-224f don't panic ! this is a whole different way of making fudge
the mixture will set once cast
storage: fudge will keep for up to two weeks at room temperature
you'll need to store it wrapped in waxed paper and in an airtight container
fudge will keep frozen for up to six months
when freezing fudge you'll need to wrap in waxed paper , store in a double-airtight container
i use double freezer baggies
thaw fudge at room temperature in its air-tight container -- it will take most of one day

note: make sure that the beans come to a simmer on top of the stove before placing them in the oven. do not use old beans, which will not soften no matter how long you simmer them. if the beans do not soften in the oven after a couple of hours, raise the heat to 300 f. if you live at a high altitude, raise the oven temperature and let the the beans bake for longer. do ahead: you can make this recipe through step 3 and store it in the refrigerator up to four days ahead of serving. top with the bread crumbs, and reheat in a 350 f oven for 15 minutes until the beans are bubbling and the bread crumbs lightly browned.

432,152,shrimp ceviche,"this is my twist on the traditional mexican ceviche (which differs from that of south american cuisine).  it's a very colorful and appealing appetizer dish, and is exceptionally low in calories.  the shrimp is ""cooked"" chemically by the acid in the lime juice, rather than physically (with heat).  you may substitute a good-quality white fish, such as halibut or mahi-mahi, for the shrimp, if desired.  depending on how fast and skilled you are with your knives, and whether you use fresh-squeezed or bottled lime juice, the initial prep for this ceviche can take anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes.","slice the ends off the cucumbers , then slice four strips lengthwise
the goal here is to get strips of cucumber with no seeds
cut each strip into smaller strips using a small , sharp knife
using a chef's or santoku knife , dice the cucumber strips into 1 / 4"" cubes
place diced cucumber into a large , sealable bowl
discard the center portion of the cucumbers
dice each of the three bell peppers similarly , using as much of the flesh as possible
add to bowl
cut a large red onion in half , peel it , and place the flat side down on a cutting board
cut off the top and bottom , then using your small knife , make a series of parallel cuts 1 / 4"" apart , perpendicular to the top / bottom cuts
the use your chef's knife to cut perpendicularly to these cuts and you'll have perfectly diced onions
add to bowl
finally , dice the chili pepper
care should be taken not to add seeds to the ceviche
if using fresh limes , zest one or two and add the lime zest to the bowl
rinse peeled , deveined , and butterflied raw shrimp and put in a large ziploc bag
pour in approximately 2 / 3 c lime juice
you can add a bit of lemon juice here , too , if desired , but lime should be predominant
if using fresh lime juice , you can throw a couple of the juiced lime halves into the bag as well
seal and lay flat in the refrigerator
finely chop the fresh cilantro , reserving enough whole leaves for garnish
add chopped cilantro to bowl
seal bowl and shake vigorously to thoroughly mix all ingredients
open and add the remaining lime juice
reseal and refrigerate
the chemical ""cooking"" process begins immediately and usually takes several hours
i like the lime flavoring to be fairly pronounced , so i let the process carry on overnight
you'll want to flip the bag and shake the bowl a couple of times during the process
the shrimp can be served whole or chopped into large pieces and incorporated into the ceviche

468,31,kosher jewish  pickles,"those of you who had the pleasure of growing up on the east coast of the united states may have had one of these traditional kosher pickles, made primarily by jewish businesses. they are by no means your store bought pickles.  they are even better then your favorite deli's pickles.  these pickles are what all other pickles are founded on; quality.  
do not be scared of making pickles.  this is easy, and i will give it to you in layman's terms.  
in a good authentic kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  none, not a drop.  what kind of pickle has no vinegar?  a good one.  think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  
how long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.  too many for you?  then its time to move on.  want a fantastic, authentic, kosher/jewish pickles?  you have found your recipe.  
let us begin.

p.s.  the jar. i get my jar(s) by buying a big jar of crap pickles from a food warehouse.  then i wash it and pour some boiling water in it, and it is ready for use.  i also boil the cap just in case, but have made many batches without ever using boiling water and i have never taken ill.  only reason i do use the boiling water on occasion is because my wife is around.","cut 1 / 16"" off the ends of the cucumbers and scrub very well
soak the cucumbers in ice water for a couple of hours
when cucumbers are almost done soaking , mix the salt and water
sterilize or wash your giant pickle jar from the food warehouse
make sure you have properly disposed of all the lousy pickles that use to be in it , i recommend your compost heap or the garbage
wash the jar or sterilize it so it no longer stinks like the vinegar they used to make there inferior pickles
now it gets real easy
pack as many of your pickles into the jar as you can
use the rest for a salad or something
stick in all the dill , all the garlic cloves , all the seeds , then stop , and look at your beautiful jar
if you have the grape leaves , stick them in at this time
i don't ever use them , but my buddy does
pour the salt water in the jar
all the way up to the top minus an inch , or a half inch or so
if you are short water , add some
tightly cover the jar with the lid that came on the giant pickle jar
cover it tightly , as hard as you can turn , stop , then tighten again just to make sure
stand back , and look at the beauty of what you have made
place jar upside down , with a towel over it , in a cool place in your home
put a plate under the jar to see if it leaks
the next day check to see if the jar leaked
if it did , it means you didn't follow my instructions
tighten the lid and turn it upright , cover it with the towel , and ignore it
walk away
leave in cool dark place for five days
if you want to leave them for a full week , more power to you
both time frames will result in a great authentic kosher pickle
